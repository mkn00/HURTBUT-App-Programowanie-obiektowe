# About the app
The program is created for a shoe wholesaler. The main task of the application is to check the stock and edit it. Also with the help of the program we can add employees and make wholesale orders. In addition, the administrator has all the capabilities of an employee and can add workers, but a person that isn't an admin can not do this.ü§©
